# üß† Zermind ‚Äì Enhanced Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## üßæ Overview

**Zermind** is an open-source AI conversation platform that revolutionizes how users interact with multiple LLM providers through **dual interaction modes**: traditional chat and groundbreaking **conversational mind maps**. It's the first platform where AI conversations themselves become the visual structure, enabling users to explore ideas through branching dialogues, multi-model debates, and resumable conversation trees.

Zermind transforms AI interaction from linear chat into **visual thinking**, making it the definitive tool for complex ideation, collaborative brainstorming, and knowledge exploration.

Zermind is built for the [Cloneathon 2025](https://cloneathon.t3.chat) and follows permissive open-source principles (MIT license).
